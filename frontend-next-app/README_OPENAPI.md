Generating an OpenAPI client for Next.js involves using a tool to transform your OpenAPI (or Swagger) specification into a type-safe client that can be used within your Next.js application. This provides benefits such as auto-completion, type checking, and reduced boilerplate code for API interactions.
The general process is as follows:
Install an OpenAPI Client Generator: Several tools can generate clients from OpenAPI specifications. Popular choices include:
@hey-api/openapi-ts: A tool specifically designed for generating TypeScript clients from OpenAPI schemas, with good integration for Next.js.
openapi-typescript-codegen: Another option for generating TypeScript clients.
Orval: A tool that can generate API clients and integrate with libraries like TanStack Query (React Query).
Install your chosen tool as a development dependency in your Next.js project. For example, using npm:
C贸digo

    npm install --save-dev @hey-api/openapi-ts
Obtain Your OpenAPI Specification:
Ensure you have your OpenAPI specification file (e.g., openapi.json or openapi.yaml). This file defines your API's endpoints, request/response structures, and data types.
Configure and Generate the Client:
Create a configuration file (e.g., heyapi.config.ts for @hey-api/openapi-ts) that points to your OpenAPI specification and specifies the output directory for the generated client. Then, run the generation command.
Example using @hey-api/openapi-ts:
TypeScript

    // heyapi.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from '@hey-api/openapi-ts';

    export default defineConfig({
      input: './path/to/your/openapi.json', // Adjust path to your spec
      output: './src/api', // Desired output directory for the client
      client: 'fetch', // Or 'axios', depending on your preference
    });
Then, add a script to your package.json to run the generator:
C贸digo

    {
      "scripts": {
        "generate-api": "hey-api generate"
      }
    }
And run it:
C贸digo

    npm run generate-api
Integrate the Generated Client in Next.js: Import and use the generated client functions within your Next.js components or API routes to interact with your backend API. The generated client will provide type-safe methods for making API calls.
TypeScript

    // Example usage in a Next.js component
    import { UsersService } from '../src/api/services/UsersService'; // Adjust import path

    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const users = await UsersService.getUsers();
        console.log(users);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching users:', error);
      }
    }
